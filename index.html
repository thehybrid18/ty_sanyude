                    Data analytics is all about uncovering insights from data and using them to make better business decisions.
                    As an analytics consultant, I've had the privilege of working with a wide range of clients, helping them to
                    unlock the power of their data. But for me, what's really exciting is creating stunning visualizations that
                    bring data to life. With tools like JavaScript and Plotly, I'm able to create beautiful, interactive
                    dashboards that showcase data in a way that's easy to understand and compelling to explore. Whether it's
                    visualizing trends over time or drilling down into granular details, I'm constantly amazed at the insights
                    that can be gleaned from well-crafted visualizations, interesting is it not?

                    <p class="lead">I use a lot of visualization apps, but Plotly is definitely one of the more
                        interactive ones. Chances are you have seen their charts on a blog or a newsite. I will share
                        more examples shortly on my site. I also tinker around with Plotly in R. Shiny web apps can be
                        powerful with R graphing libraries as well. Here is a <a
                            href="https://thehybrid18.shinyapps.io/shiny1/">SHINNY APP</a> that I made with the tableau
                        superstore dataset. I just want to show you what I can do. And on a side note, I couldn't
                        resist sharing this stunning NASA picture that I randomly came across - it's been popping up on
                        a few sites lately and I just had to share it. But back to the matter at hand - I'll be sharing
                        more of my own visualizations and examples shortly on my site, so stay tuned!</p>

                    <p class="lead">This is based on a college project I did not too long ago. We used python for data
                        cleansing (scraping, etl processing with sql alchemy, etc.) and azure ml to help us predict
                        whether or not a flight was safe. The company wanted to analyze costly lost flights due to
                        weather and other reasons to see if there were areas of improvement. For example, if a flight
                        is lost due to bad weather reported by the pilot we could create an analytics solution within
                        the dashboard to look at lost flights that were actually capturable. It gave our dashboard solid
